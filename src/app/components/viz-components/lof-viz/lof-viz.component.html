      This is a simple visualization of scheduled line of flights for a date range. The schedule is randomly generated by
      creating random <b>Rotations</b> which are <b>Circular Linked Lists</b>. Flights are then generated using these
      rotations to set origins and destinations for each flight.

      Each flight is clickable to drill into the details of a flight and allow for canceling a flight or adjusting the
      out/in time slightly (retiming). Note that canceling a flight requires canceling that entire rotation since there will
      be no aircraft to fly at the next station. This is a very simplified version of scheduling, but you know.
